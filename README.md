# femto
Working my may through the ["Build Your Own Text Editor"](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) tutorial.

Calling my editor femto because it will be smaller (feature-wise) than nano, pico, or even kilo!

Paige licensed the code for the editor developed in their tutorial under the BSD 2-Clause license and so this repo is as well!
